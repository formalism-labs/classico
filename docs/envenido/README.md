## Tool for managing configuration of shell environments

***Envenido*** manages configuration of tools and systems (hosts) by use of environment variables, defined in scripts and organized into named "environments" that can be activated when needed.

This can be used either interactively (as in an interactive shell) or automatically (e.g. with a build like GNU make).

Envnenido also offers some shell prompt management facilities:

* Configuration of the shell prompt (utilizing [Starship](https://starship.rs/)),
* Organization of shell configuration scripts (e.g. `.bashrc`), shell aliases, and shell functions,

* Organization of `profile.d` scripts,
